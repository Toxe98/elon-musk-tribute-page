                <li>2000 - <span class="bold">X.com merged with online back Confinity to avoid competition, as

                <li>2006 - <span class="bold">Space attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket. Though the
                    rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital
